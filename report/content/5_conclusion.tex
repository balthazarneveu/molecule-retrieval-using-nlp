\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
During this project, we faced the difficult problem of contrastive learning with the additional burden of complex data structures (natural language sentences and sparse graphs stuctures). By iteratively exploring the vast amount of combinations of hyper parameters, architectures and loss functions (more than a hundred experiments with at least half a day of training each), we trained seven equally accurate models. By ensembling, these models achieved together a final LRAP score of 0.905.  With an engineering effort as significant as the amount of time spent experimenting on the machine learning part of the project, we came up with a solution which can retrieve molecules from a text query.
