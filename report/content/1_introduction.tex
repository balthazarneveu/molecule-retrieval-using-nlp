\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Text-2-Mol \cite{text2mol} introduced the groundings of the problem of pairing a text description with the corresponding molecule.
Their contribution also cam with a dataset made of 33k which is always appreciated among the research community.
Here we're using this dataset and the problem is restricted to using this data solely.
We're leveraging the language understanding contained in pretrained Large Language Models (LLM) to create embeddings for text descriptions.
We at least start with models that have good understanding of the English language. The whole point is to transfer this knowledge to the chemical domain to be able to understand molecule structure from a description.
